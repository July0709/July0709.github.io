The Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectivity (NBC) Laboratory is a cognitive neuroimaging research lab based at [Florida International University](https://www.fiu.edu) in Miami, Florida, led by Drs. [Angela Laird](https://nbclab.github.io/team/laird-angela) and [Matthew Sutherland](https://nbclab.github.io/team/sutherland-matthew).

The NBC Lab is located on FIU’s [MMC Campus](https://campusmaps.fiu.edu/docs/MMC.pdf) in the [Academic Health Center 4](https://campusmaps.fiu.edu/index.html#/campus/MMC) building (AHC-4 Room 380).

The NBC Lab uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), combined with functional connectivity, meta-analysis, and neuroinformatics approaches, to study the functional organization of the human brain.

Our work focuses on understanding brain function in the context of substance use, adolescent development, and educational learning. To achieve these goals, we embrace open science principles and adopt best practices to promote reproducible neuroimaging results. If you would like to know more about specific projects, you are welcome to visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/NBCLab) and the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/m4x75/). For more about the NBC Lab, please see our [Lab Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12QHTfVnjxmVAk9pki2hhspnFJB7QeDR3scstHV8KE_c/edit?usp=sharing).

Miami is a vibrant, multicultural, and multilingual urban metropolis. Collectively, the NBC Lab seeks to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment that provides opportunities to support a diverse group of trainees, while engaging with participant groups who have been historically underrepresented in research, including communities of color.
